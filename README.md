Installer for the ARX anonymization tool
====

This project contains configuration files for building the ARX installer.
The installer is created using BitRock InstallBuilder (v9).

For OSX, the following [bugfix](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/105553/1/features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable.feature/bin/cocoa/macosx/x86_64/Eclipse.app/Contents/Info.plist) currently needs to be applied manually after the app has been bundled.

Hashes are created with HashMyFiles.

Hashes are signed with Gpg4win.
